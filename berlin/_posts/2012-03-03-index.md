### Topic
This Hack Day is about Climate and Energy Data, but any cool hacks are fine.

Featuring the awesome Gregor Aisch, the amazing Marian Steinbach, the excellent Friedrich Lindenberg and the formidable Stefan Wehrmeyer.

### Location and Schedule
The hack day will be held at the St. Oberholz Ko-Working space (above the cafe) at Rosenthaler Platz. Ring the bell at "Le Bureau".
On both days the Hack Day may start at 10am and may close at 7pm (TBD). Contact one of the above on Twitter to make sure.
